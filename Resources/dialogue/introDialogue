= Narration


It's a rather quiet Train car, it's destination is unknown, it's design bizzare. = S_train You sit in the corner of the room never exactly sure of what you might find. - 30 You read the paper ... - 17 Look Up ...





It's still a train car. Enrico spent so long staring at 12 point font type that the world around him is starting to turn fuzzy. - 30 Enrico knows why ...












Renowned Journalist Enrico Saliday. If there's one thing he can do is tell a story. A hope fills his heart the strange tang of a sense of pride, a sense of belonging and most of all sense of purpose - 31 ...
He's travelled all the way to Kacovo to cover the death of a religious prophet â€“ at least that's what the locals say. He doesn't know what to believe but as he looks out to the grassy hills, towering mountains and syncronised birds he has a sense that the spirit lives here. - 32 ...
$ B Her. $ A sweet in a black dress sits across from you. She interrupts your train of thought. - 33 ...
= Jenny_Speaking = Jenny_Neutral Hey can you pass the salt. - 40 [Pass the salt without a word] - 35 Of course darling. - 45 Why did you sit here?

 




[ ( !with_word | Without a word ) Enrico passes the salt she lightly salts her french onion soup than looks back up] = D_jenny_has_salt - 44 ...
= Jenny_Happy You from around here? ( D_jenny_has_salt | [she begins playing around with the salt shaker ) - 50 Just a journalist - 55 [Lie] Yes.
= Jenny_Concerned Hmm. I'm not sure. [ Her body squeezes itself like an accordian than decompresses out. ] But I can move if you want me to = Jenny_Confident - 60 Yes that would be nice. - 65 Now why we would we do something like that?




= Jenny_Speaking = J_KNOWS_JOURNALIST We don't get a lot of those here. - 75 Hi. Nice to meet you. - 76 And what pray tell are you. 









= Narration She flashes her eyelashes, her deep blue eyes reflecting nothing but the warmth of the shallow water of a childs swimming pool. She gets up and moves along with her soup. Enrico watches closely, maybe even a little too closely, the sway of her tight black dress mesmerizing his full vision like passing landscape on a train. - 300 ... 



= Narration Just the briefest flash, a smile. = Jenny_Speaking I'm not sure perhaps if you simply passed the salt now [she giggles polietly = S_jenny_giggle ] - 46 [Still don't pass the salt] - 43 Pass the salt = with_word











[She considers your question for a second. I'm Jenny, nice to meet you ... - 77 Enrico. Enrico Saliday
Alright well Mr. Saliday I'm charmed. - 78 ...
= Narration A silence passes over the two of you. Every once in a while one of you will look up, Enrico feels his leg shaking, he just hopes she doesn't. - 79 ...
= Jenny_Speaking I ... ( J_KNOWS_JOURNALIST | 
> You write any good stores latetly? - 85 [Stare at her confused] )
> ( !J_KNOWS_JOURNALIST |
> You never did tell me what your doing on this train to the middle of no where? - 90 Come on darling don't be so harsh to ... Kocovo - 97 A writer ... eh um Journalist )







= j_s It really is the middle of no where. Not a single good place for coffee. - 91 ...
= p_s So ? It has a - 92 = HISTORY Rich History - 92 = people Joyous people
( history | Sure as I've heard ... ) ( people | Yes they've been nothing but wonderful to me. ) Still you must admit this is quite far from the standards of Channel Countries. - 93 Why of course
Yes but of course. ( D_jenny_has_salt | [she twirls the salt shaker and then looks up at you, those $ B eyes $ ) - 94 [She stares back at you]
I'm still waiting for an answer - 96 What was that?
An answer ... Why are you here? - 97 Oh that well ...

I am a Journalist for the Brighten Gazette, come to tell the story of the dead slash dying prophet up in the Carapithian mountains of Kocovo. - 98 [Continue] - 99 [Let her respond]
... They say he is the second coming of Christ, it - 105 !






= j_s What really! How can that ... - 106 Well as I was saying
This isn't a matter of possibility it's a situation of someone telling a story, and people believing him. It's no crime.
= j_s well it should be. One day someone important will get hurt by a story. Then we'll see what we care about then. Hey you ever cried because of something you read in the paper
No?
Well I have. A police dog died, they showed a picture of him in the paper. His name was roger. [Her eyes bolster up, she clearly feels for this dog, she looks at enrico again then at the ground] Sorry who cares anyways, just a dumb dog.
No ...



































































































































































































It was quite a lunch but he has to get up and go now. - 0
