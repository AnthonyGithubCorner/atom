You approach a D 20 bizarre abandoned building D on your D 18 day walk D D 2 ... D
[ A shy ampfiphian like creature waddles up to you D 3 ... D ]
Hey D 4 buddy! D This is my swamp.
Yah I'm talking to you, D 5 weird hairry man. D I said! D 9 Get out of my swamp! D

Yah that's right this is my D 10 swamp. D
What do you mean this looks like an D 11 abandoned D building. This is a swamp. [ He clearly seems to be suffering from some sort of D 12 delusion D ]
My best guess as to why it's abandoned is that there is no one here except me cause unlike a certain D 21 someone D they got it through their thick skull that this is my D 13 home. D
[ Best just do D 14 what it says D ]
Yes how many times to I have to repeat this is my home! And your D 14 not welcomed D

Me! Well I ought a, he takes out a magical pistol and strikes you through the heart ! THE END *
Okay, Okay, now I'm asking you D 15 one more time D , D 9 get out of my swamp! D

It's a habit you developed young, always D 19 walking from place to place D , one day it will lead you to D 2 trouble. D
Yes you've been to many places like this, but something here feels D 2 awry D ... 
The building is barely 2 stories tall, you say barely because the second story has since caved it ... A terrible interest takes hold of you. D 2 What will you find? D
[ The creature means you ] D 12 ... D
