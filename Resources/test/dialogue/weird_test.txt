The rain is falling still. It is almost soothing. Almost ... scattered at your feet are all the D 2 empty promises * , the late nights you will never get back. You taste the pity of the papers. It tastes ... comfortable. Like bread between meals. But the guilt is still there. D 5 continue writing. *
Yes... Empty - except not really. They are filled with black stencil marks and hastly mascaraded delusions pretending to be D 3 math. * D 1 and it is still raining *
You start to enjoy it, sometimes, but not always. If you could just get D 10 good enough * just D 6 maybe... * No matter you hear D 1 it. *

You pick up the pencil. It is a natural extenstion of yourself. You write. You draw and D 6 worst of all you wonder * .
Wonder. You look outside your window, suddenly you are struck by the immediate realization that the man walking his dog along the pillars of light will never meet you. You wonder if that's for the better? D 1 It rains on the dog not the owner *


Feeling you love to have them and you love to hate them. Sometimes it good to submit to feeling cause they are more real than any D 2 empty promises * However, that just leads to the D 10 feeling. *
At some point it seems like anything is possible and then you realise that because D 12 it is * . Your inside today. It rains outside. And the world goes D 11 round and round. *
Yes round and round. There's a story in D 12 superman * where he realises that he can fly fast enough that he can actually D 35 reverse * the D 13 speed of time * by circling round the earth. It doesn't make anysense but that's D 12 comic books * for ya.  
There is a point when you D 9 feel * invisible. Truely and otherly unstoppable. That's when your the most dangerous, because you forget how D 16 weak * you sometimes can be.
Time used to make sense. It used to be linear. Not anymore, I wonder sometimes why the clock slows down when you look at it. Perhaps it is just scared of being D 14 looked at. * I don't like that trick, it shouldn't be like that.
At somepoint we are all scared of being looked at, however there really is nothing to be afraid of – in that regard. Once you get over that hump you are suddenly met by the realisation that there is no one D 15 worth looking – at.
What is a man. I say as the D 1 rain in this story * fails D 17 ever more * . Perhaps I need D 30 sleep * that is what makes a man. Is anyone worth looking at. Words are probably worth more. At least that's how it D 9 feels like anyways * . 
No one is weak. Except you and me and a sapling D 25 tree. * We all do things sometimes, the D 18 soul * gets degraded slowly by the D 20 mass of the everyday * . It can not be sustained, nothing can be sustained D 17 for ever. *
Ever is a long time. It's a shame really that we will never see it. I don't think a D 15 man * on earth as ever wanted less time. They might D 9 feal * like they've lived ! too long * but never that they need less time. Funny isn't it we all want to D 35 change the past * and we can't bear the future so the only thing we want is more time in the present. D 30 I need sleep *
The bible saids there are 7 sins. They are in order sloth, greed, envy, lust, wrath, gluttony, and one more. It is facsinating the universal experience of the soul slowly dieing. I refuse to believe for a second there exists a man immune from gambling. For if he existed he would be a saint and only D 19 Jesus Christ * never sinned, but he was cheating.
Some rocks are best left unturned. Unfortuantantly I'm not that smart. I think the last one should be too much D 6 wondering. * It can't be good for you and it destroys the D 18 soul. * It's up there with gambling for me.










Sleep I hate it. D 17 I need more time. * Even when I waste my nights like D 1 this * it is still better than that.




Back in time baby, the one place D 15 man * as never gone. It is a shame really. I'm sure we would have loved it. Like space. But we'd eventually get bored of it too. There is D 17 only so much time. Only so much. * Truthfully I need D 30 sleep *
